                    <h4>Comparison of reinforcement learning approaches</h4>
                    <p>I implemented part of the most reinforcement learning methods. Their functionality is demonstrated and compared to each other. This project can be used to find the right algorithm for a given problem as well as the best fitting hyperparameters.

                    <p>As part of my BachelorÂ´s thesis I explored the limits of the neural engine on a smartphone processor, and evaluated the practicality within those limits. My main focus was on image processing and Convolutional Neural Networks.</p>

                    <h4>Development of a combination tool for material databases</h4>
                    <p>My work in this project involved developing a tool to combine the access of multiple material research APIs. It unifies the process and merges the results. These are getting cached, creating a small database of its own that can be accessed faster and with fewer restrictions.

                    <h4>Website development and Fun</h4>
                    <p>I have already developed many single page websites like this one. Also fullstack websites were developed, with a Flask or Nodejs middleware and SQL or NoSQL as database. This skill is very valuable for the implementation of "shower thoughts".
                        During the process, keeping up the fun is essential for mantaining high motivation and success.</p>
